This project compares multiple parallel algorithms used to compute the Mandelbrot set.

Raw sample results can be found under output/csv. I also included a few sample images generated by the Program.

A description of the algorithms and interpretation of the results can be found in german as a pdf at the top level of the repository.

The sample size has been reduced for demonstration to 100 images in order to run in less than five minutes. If you run the program it generates a csv file containing the individual computation times of the different methods. It also saves images of all the computed areas. These results will be saved in the output folder.
